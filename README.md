# comphep-postscripts

Scripts for CompHEP data processing used in M.Sc. thesis on dark matter 

# Dark Matter Collider Analysis Toolkit

This repository contains scripts and tools developed during my M.Sc. research related to multicomponent dark matter models and their collider phenomenology.

The tools are designed to process, filter, and visualize model data under experimental limitations of the LUX-ZEPLIN experiment.

> Note: All scripts in this repository are project-specific and rely on a fixed internal folder and file structure. They were not designed for general reuse but serve as an integral part of a larger research workflow.

# Included Scripts

### `filter_by_experiment.py` (CLI)

Filters model parameter points generated by CompHEP simulations using LUX-ZEPLIN limitations. Produces a filtered dataset based on cross-section comparisons.

### `interpolate_and_plot.py` (CLI)

Interpolates the filtered parameter space from `filtered_results.xlsx` onto a regular 2D grid (`m_hi`, `lambda`) and visualizes the distribution of $\sin\theta$ as a smooth 3D surface.
